## Dataset

The dataset currently being used for anomoly detetcion is the CamNuvem CCTV Dataset that can be found here under the videos directory:

This dataset is being used to train an anomaly detetction model by identifying crime data.

The second dataset that will be used for crime classification is the UCF-Crime Dataset that can be found here:

This dataset contains 14 classes of crime with videos under each class.

## Performance

The current model is trained on the CamNuvem CCTV Dataset and detects anomalies in the video with 84% accuracy and 74% precision on the test dataset.
